### Sprint Goal
- [x] Build Database
- [ ] Create business layer
- [ ] Build initial GUI
- [ ] Make a Create Game method
- [x] Update README file
- [x] Commit changes to Github
- [ ] Complete Review
- [ ] Complete Retrospective

### Sprint Review
I completed the database with the 5 tables which I intended to create. Each table uses unique table names, foreign keys are referenced, correct data types are used etc.
I managed to nearly finish the business layer for User Story 0.2 however this was incomplete so I will complete it in Sprint 2. The GUI file was created and referenced to the business layer however it was not implemented and currently displays nothing, so this too will be set for Sprint 2.

### Sprint Retrospective
I overestimated how much work I'd be able to get done within the class time. However, our time was cut a little bit short due to having a Data test in the morning. I may also meet the criteria of my User Stories faster if I focus on one at a time rather than trying to do bits of each one simultaneously. There was also an error relating to absence of .dll files which took over an hour to resolve so this also slowed me down
